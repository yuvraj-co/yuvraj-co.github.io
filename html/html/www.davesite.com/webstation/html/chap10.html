	<tt><b><font size=+2>Using FTP to upload...</font></b></tt>

	<tr><td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
	<p>Some web hosts no longer require you to use FTP to publish your files.  Instead, they have an upload via web browser function.  While upload via web browser is useful to send perhaps one or two files, it can be tedious to send multiple files. Nearly all web hosts support FTP, and that is why I choose to explain it in detail. It is also a good skill to have if you plan to design web sites for other people.</p>
	<p>The FTP tutorial is now located in a separate chapter, <a href="chap10_2.html">10.2</a>. <a href="chap10_2.html">Click here to read the FTP tutorial chapter</a>.

	<tt><b><font size=+2>How to structure your Links...</font></b></tt>

	<tr><td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
	<p>As a beginner, it is probably best to leave all files, HTML and graphics, in one directory.  That way, when you link to and from your files with <tt>&lt;a href=&quot;<b>filename.html</b>&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</tt> you do not need to have the full path.<br><br>For example, say you have two pages:<br><br>http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/index.html<br>http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/links.html<br><br>If you want to place a link from the index.html page to the links.html page, all you need to put is <tt>&lt;a href=&quot;links.html&quot;&gt;My Links Page&lt;/a&gt;</tt>.  If you are editing your links.html page, and want to link it to the index.html, all you need to type is <tt>&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;My Home Page&lt;/a&gt;</tt>.<br><br>
Now if you want to get a little more advanced and your host supports directories, things get a little more challenging.  Let's say you have a pet and you want it to have a web page at http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/mypet/.  So you decide to create a directory on your hard drive as c:\homepage\mypet.  Then you (or your pet) writes a home page called index.html and saves it to c:\homepage\mypet\index.html.  You log onto your ftp server, and make a directory called mypet.  You upload your pet's index.html file into that directory.<br><br>
Now your File Structure looks like this:<br><br>
http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/index.html<br>
http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/links.html<br>
http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/mypet/index.html<br><br>
On YOUR index.html page, you want a link to your pet's index.html page in the mypet directory.  The most common way to do this is type out the full URL (uniform resource locator) as <br><br><tt>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/mypet/&quot;&gt;Visit My Pet's Page!&lt;/a&gt;</tt><br><b>OR</b><br><tt>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/mypet/index.html&quot;&gt;Visit My Pet's Page!&lt;/a&gt;</tt><br><br>
But because your index.html is in the directory http://www.yourhost.com/~YOURNAME/ you can do it an easier way.  Remember how when you linked to links.html from index.html without using the full URL? Well that is because they are in the same directory.  Since your pet's home page is only one directory further down, all you need to type for the link is:<br><br>
<tt>&lt;a href=&quot;mypet/index.html&quot;&gt;Visit My Pet's Page!&lt;/a&gt;</tt><br><b>OR</b><br><tt>&lt;a href=&quot;mypet/&quot;&gt;Visit My Pet's Page!&lt;/a&gt;</tt><br><br>
Now you have a link to your pet's page... but say you want (or your pet wants) to link to your index.html in /~YOURNAME/. Because the directory is up one directory in the file structure, you can use two periods (<tt>..</tt>) and then a slash (<tt>/</tt>) to move back.  So you are editing your pet's index.html page in the directory mypet and want to link to your page... here is how you can do it:<br><br>
<tt>&lt;a href=&quot;../index.html&quot;&gt;Visit My Owner's Page!&lt;/a&gt;</tt><br><b>OR</b><br><tt>&lt;a href=&quot;../&quot;&gt;Visit My Owner's Page!&lt;/a&gt;</tt><br><br>

	<tr><td bgcolor=#FFFFFF><p>

        <tr><td bgcolor=#DFE2ED>
	<tt><b><font size=+2>Important Read about Copyright Laws</font></b></tt>

	<tr><td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
	<p>All copyright laws still apply on the Internet as they do in other media.  But it is often confusing about what is legal to do and what isn't.  All original web pages on the web are copyrighted by their authors unless noted otherwise.  <b>Pages that do not have a Copyright &copy; notice can still be protected under copyright laws, and almost always are.  All images (including backgrounds, icons, etc.) are copyrighted.  In order to use them you must have permission from the author.  Links to pages are not copyrighted, so you may link to copyrighted pages, but you may not use them as though they were yours. (to get the &copy; symbol in your page, use the html code <tt>&amp;copy;</tt> .)</b><br><br>

<font size=+1>Legal stuff you can do:</font><br>
<ul>
 <li>Write Original Pages, make Original Graphics, and claim copyright on them.
 <li>Link to another web page that does not belong to you, as long as you do not claim it is yours.
 <li>Use graphics files that are noted as "free", such as graphics from a "free backgrounds" page or "free icons" page.
 <li>Use someone else's graphics with their permission.
 <li>Express your opinions on someone else's web page on your page, as long as no material from their page is used in your page. (You must realize that if you do this to them, and they don't like it, they can do the same to you.)
</ul>
<font size=+1>Illegal stuff you can't do:</font><br>
<ul>
 <li>Take someone else's web page and/or graphics, unmodified, and use it on your server.
 <li>Take someone else's web page and/or graphics, modify it, and claim ownership upon it.
 <li>Take someone else's graphics files, such as backgrounds, pictures, etc., and use them in your web pages.
 <li>Post or use <b>any copyrighted material</b> without permission of the copyright holder, whether it be text, books, magazine articles or pictures, music, whatever.  If you didn't create it, and it's not in the public domain, chances are you can't use it.
 <li>A lot more, if you get in trouble, for something else, tell me so I can add it. <a href="mailto:webmaster@davesite.com">webmaster@davesite.com</a>.
