<p>I recently moved my web server over to <a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-462266-815908" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='http://www.futurequest.net/';return true;" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true;">FutureQuest</a> servers.  My old host had been neglecting me for years, and now they finally began to upgrade my server, however, they wished to more than double my monthly fee.  We had different opinions.  I wanted more bandwidth and less disk space.  They wanted to give me less bandwidth and more disk space.  It became obvious that I would have to move my site quickly, because the new pricing came into effect in about three weeks.

<p>I had already hosted one site with FutureQuest. My father needed a site for his business, and FutureQuest seemed to be the best value for the price.  So I looked over the plans.  <b>There was a decent one with all the bells and whistles for, surprise-surprise, <i>$15 less per month</i> than I was currently paying.</b>  It came with 300MB of space and 20GB of data transfer/month.  Each extra MB of data transfer was only a penny, while most other hosts charged five cents or more per extra MB.  (A week later I found out the host I was with wanted to charge an outrageous ten cents per extra MB.)

<p>So the deal sounded good--almost too good.  I figured the tech support would be shoddy.  I sent an e-mail to support at around midnight describing my situation.   I got a response from the CEO within a half hour (I am by no means a celebrity, so getting a response from a CEO, and in the middle of the night, was quite a surprise.)

<p>Within 24 hours of the first e-mail, I uploaded a copy of my site to the new server at FutureQuest.  <b>This server was a lot more powerful than the one at my old host, and it had many more features.</b>  I notified Network Solutions of the server change so that over the next few days davesite.com would point to the new location instead of the old location.

<p>Admittingly, most people won't need 20GB of data transfer per month.  (There are a bunch of nice plans at FutureQuest that can probably suit your hosting needs for a really good price.  I have the most expensive of the plans because I have a very popular web site.)  <b>It was nice to be treated as an important customer and not like a hassle.</b>  I would recommend FutureQuest to anyone looking for a reasonable, low-cost, feature-packed virtual host for their web site.  (And yes, I'm only paying $60 a month to host my web site of about a million pageviews a month.)
