	<tr><td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
<p>If your host allows you to have commercial banners and advertisements on your site, there are a variety of companies that will pay you for placing banners or buttons or sometimes even search boxes on your site.  Generally, there are four ways to generate revenue:

<ul>
 <li><b>Cost per Ad displayed:</b> usually referred to as CPM (or cost per thousand shows), this was a once common form of advertising on the Internet.  For smaller sites, it seems to have died off, although a few sites still pay it.  This type of advertising means that you get paid a certain set amount for every time someone loads your page.
 <li><b>Cost per Click on Ad:</b> usually referred to as a CPC (cost per click), this is probably one of the most common forms of advertising on the Internet.  Usually payout is from 1 cent per click to 25 cents per click.  This means you will get money any time someone clicks a banner on your site.
 <li><b>Cost per Action:</b> usually called a CPA, this is a form of payment for when someone does something, such as fills out a form, orders a service, or orders a product.  Commissions sometimes fall into this category.
 <li><b>Commission:</b> Payment when the someone buys something.
</ul>

And, of course, an obvious way to make money (requires a bit more work)...

<ul>
 <li><b>Selling a Product or Service: </b> <a href="#img">click here for more information</a>.

	<tt><b><font size=+2>What kind of traffic (number of visits) do I have to have to be profitable?</font></b></tt>

	<tr><td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
	<p>It really varies.  If your site only gets five hundred visitors per month, you may make less than a dime.  Then again, you could make a few bucks.  It all depends on circumstances.  If your site gets thousands of visitors per month, you will probably make quite a few bucks.

	<p>First you need to check if your host allows banners.  Next, you check out the options (there are many others, I've just included a select few I've found reliable.)  Bookmark this page to use as a reference.  When you sign up for one of the banner programs, they will give you HTML code to place on your page(s).  A little warning:  Most companies won't pay you until you've earned at least $10 or $20.  This may take you from a day to a few months.  But once you have the HTML code up, you don't have to do anything else (except update your site once in a while) to earn money.

	<p>Over the past few months I have received numerous positive comments about my tutorial by people coming from <a href="http://www.marketingtips.com/t.cgi/51472/">Corey Rudl's Internet Marketing Center </a>.  I wanted to find out a little bit more about who Corey Rudl was, and why people kept saying he recommended me, so I checked out his site.

<p>I was very surprised at the exceptional quality of information offered at the <a href="http://www.marketingtips.com/t.cgi/51472/">Internet Marketing Center</a>.  Corey offers sections on a variety of topics you can view on his web site for free, and you can also signup for a free newsletter he offers about tips in Internet marketing.  I've gone through a lot of Corey's material, and while there is a point or two I may disagree with him on (like openly discussing bulk e-mail marketing) there are so many pages of useful information on his site. Corey's site can give you many straight answers to questions that you may have otherwise spent months trying to figure out for yourself.  (Believe me, I know. The year 2000 is my fourth year on the Internet as a business & web site, and I discovered, or should I say "re-discovered", countless tips in Corey's guides that could have saved me months of works had I found and read his course earlier on in my venture.  He's done a great job of bringing the best tips together in a concise package.)

The <a href="http://www.marketingtips.com/t.cgi/51472/">Internet Marketing Center</a> also offers a full course you can purchase entitled "The Insider Secrets to Marketing Your Business on the Internet" if you want a more in-depth, easy-to-follow guide.   If you are selling a service or product online, you should definitely consider your next stop after taking this HTML tutorial to be to check out his web site, his newsletters, and his course.

	<tt><b><font size=+2>pure cash for selling t-shirts? mugs? mousepads?</font></b></tt>

	<tr><td bgcolor=#EEEEEE>
	<p>I've come across a relatively new company recently that allows you to design and sell t-shirts, mugs, mousepads, and more through their site at no cost to you.  You design the images, upload them and customize them until you're satisfied, and then place a link on your site to your personal "store" where they can be purchased online.  You don't have to take the orders or ship the products personally, it is all done through this company. (They just send you checks for your sales!) You set the price above the cost, and the difference is pure profit!  (E.g. say the mousepad base price is $10.99.  If you sell it for $11.99, you'll make $1 per mousepad, at $12.99, you'll make $2 per mousepad, etc...)
        <p>I've set up my own store to test out their services.  I ordered a t-shirt and a mousepad and I'm fairly pleased.  You can check out my store at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/davesitecom/">cafepress.com/davesitecom/</a> for an example (or if you really want to buy a shirt or mousepad, feel free!).
